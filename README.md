Student: Þór Tómasarson

Advisor: Eyjólfur Ingi Ásgeirsson


This project was meant to ease the process of development for new logic on the Gavia. The main goal was to assist with development of the obstacle avoidance sonar of the Gavia.
The required setup for a full scale testing framework is:
*	Dynamic model of the Gavia.
*	Environment to run the tests on.
*	Be able to plot and analyze the results.
See Info.pdf for more information on setup and usage of the code.
